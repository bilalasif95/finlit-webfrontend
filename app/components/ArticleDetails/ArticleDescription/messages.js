    defaultMessage: `FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE Fort Lauderdale, FL, Aug 13, 2021 – According to stats from the National Association of Realtors (NAR) made in 2020, the typical U.S. home will be on the market for an average of 24 days, estimating an average of 56 days to close on a purchase loan. That is around 90 days or a little over two months, from listing to closing. But since most of the sales depend on the season when you’re selling or the social/economical situation around the city/country, selling a house could become a really difficult task. And there’s nothing more stressful than needing to sell your house in a short amount of time. Being under the clock might lead you to sign a deal that won’t seem so convenient in the future when you have ASAP Cash Home Buyers help available. Don’t bet on “quick solutions” as foreclosure, which will only drop significantly your credit score, and many years of expensive and limited credit will be some of the long-term consequences of foreclosure, making financial recovery very difficult, if not near to impossible.
